# Try-Hard-PasswordGen
## Description

This was a very tough endeavor for me, learning JavaScript has been a bumpy start. It was super important for me to conquer this challenge, wanted to give up but didn't give in.

I created a function to generate a password where the user is prompted to choose the length and what type of characters they want in their password.

I learned that if you slow down, try to break down the problem one piece at a time with pseudo code... makes it much easier! Also, looking at it as if you are translating a language. If you speak more then one language, you usually formulate things based on the main language you use.
## Usage

Load up the page, press the generate password button, follow the prompts, boom! Password ;D

## Credits

- Couldn't have done it without the help of my tutor Patrick Meehan, really helped me slow down and not over complicate it
- Help of Google and AI search engines to better understand the Randomizer function I created.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
